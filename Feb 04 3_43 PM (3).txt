What Traditional computing is ? 
                                Purchase and use the basic resources (CapeX + Opex)Servers, cooling , area 
								team to handel servers
								Banks wont replace easily
What Cloud computing is ? (oPx)
creation of resources on on demand which are remotely located in another location .Pay as you go.
Usually startups and new age companies

What is  Datacenter , VM , 

AWS - 1st and one of the top players 
Gartner quadrant
https://aws.amazon.com/resources/analyst-reports/22-global-gartner-mq-cips/
Select cloud based on the usecase 
Azure in india -- rupees
AWS big in US - Usually dollars
ML and Kube - GCP


Reliability

ability to recover from failures example

Scalability
example - black friday

Security 

Cost effectiveness -- 
Performance Efficiency - max use of hardware resources
Flexibility-- Check definition in PPT


Regions - locations where AWS DCs are present --SEE in Portal 
https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/
walkthrough of region short codes .-- Needed for using in Code

AZs ( Connected and physically isolated )
Multiple AZs within a region - 3 to 6 Need for AZs - DR , HA , < 100 KM 
connected via high speed networks cable

if region goes down then what ?
Hence multi region DR .

AWS management console 
100+ services impossible to know all
ohio and virginia only available in simplilearn

AWS free tier

AWS IAM 
Authentication Authorisation .
Allows Users to control AWS resources
Allows AWS resources to connect and control other AWS resources

eg Ec2 to S3 , Ec2 to RDS
aws s3 ls

AWS Services 
Just idea of services . Its ok if you dont get it.
Clasification into 4 

Compute
services providing processing power eg laptop

Storage
RAW storage eg hardrive

Database
Data in the form of row colum to query and analyse

Networking 
 Services that connect other services



Day -2 


Support plans
https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/plans/



EC2 instance types ( 10 min )
https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/
General purpose
memory optimised
accelerated computing
storage optimised

EC2 Demo Windows machine  -- Show 
Root contains OS
other EBS are like Hard Disk drives
Components of instance -- Instance type - RAM , CPU etc

Ec2 Linux
ec2 instance connect


On Demand -- launch

Savings plan
when to go for it ? what is it ?
Term of the plan - 1 or 3
more towards dollar value per hour

Reserved instance -- fixed instances

spot instances 
Why ? =  to fill gap
huge discounts 
whats the catch - can go anytime if bid is higher
what about my data - extra drive will be there . Only root goes.
Dont use for PROd instances
usecase -- Sale period

Dedicated Hosts
how VMs work on HW ? 
High costs as dedicated HW and highest performance. 
Price 2 to 3 times of ondemand  

https://aws.amazon.com/architecture/icons/

https://medium.com/@shrutipal700/hosting-a-website-on-windows-virtual-machine-61fd427e1ef4

EBS -- Primary storage of instance 
•	It is a Block storage attached to one VM at a time
•	We can create and attach multiple EBS Vol to VM
•	REMEBER EBS SHOULD BE IN SAME AZ AS EC2

Concepts --
IOPS - input output operations per second 
            Number of read write operations on your disk / access made to disk -- DB operations
Throughput - amount of data that you read at a time .		
        - Big data, data warehouse
        
Types 

https://aws.amazon.com/ebs/features/

Types of EBS
SSD ( Solid state drive)-- 
GP2,Gp3
Io1,I02 ,i02 Express block
HDD ( Hard disk drive )
St1 , sc1
Create a Disk - demo 
EBS encryption

AMI - OS + custom  ( Public , Private )
Collection of OS + Software and any configuration / custom settings on the software.
eg - Apache configuration , chrome installation
Demo - chrome installed
Tags while creating AMI

AWS ROLES
Interconnectivety of services why needed ? how to do ?

EC2 to S3 , Ec2 to RDS ( DB )

CLI
In production they use automation using CLI , SDKs
why and who use cli -- devops guys to control AWS resources using CMD
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html

eg Ec2 to S3 , Ec2 to RDS
aws s3 ls

What is a loadbalancer 
Benefits of Load balancer

•	Distribute requests across multiple healthy resources
• Avoid sigle point of failure 
•	Uses Health checks
•	Within a region
Application load balancer
Layer 7 , URI based request , based on HTTP , HTTPS
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSI_model
ecommerece , Social media ,
Target group
Health checks

Network Loadbalancer
•	For high performance , Gaming , millions of connections
•	Layer 4 , TCP , UDP protocol
•	Static IP address

Classic - discontinued

Gateway Loadbalancer 

Connect to Virtual appliances Next gen firewalls , WAF etc

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSI_model

Load balancer steps

Select LB SG  -- 
Target Group -- Ec2s , ip address , loadbalancer
Health checks -- to monitor health of our VMs
Load balancing rules -- RR , LC 
listners  -- Port ( 80 , 443) ( HTTP , HTTPS)


a Create EC2 , install apache and take AMI
b Launch template
c Auto scaling  groups

1 Creation of ASG tracking policy -- ( 10 % ,50 % , 70 % , 80 %) , select the AZ , subnets
2 Min , Max , Desired capacity
3 Load balancer -- ( TG  and Attach it to ASG )
4 ASG will automatically add and remove VMs from the LB ( TG )

ASG --- Automation to add and remove instances
TG ( its collection of anything )---  LB ()


increase or descrease in cpu utilisation will add or delete resources


Stop instances in LB and show

Types of cost
Storage cost - 1MB , 1 GB
duration -- how long 
cost for download --

SRR
CRR


S3 is a global object based storage service -- ( google drive , one drive etc)
data is store regionally

bucket --- Buckets are locations where we store data S3.
objects -- .txt , images , viedos , .xml ,


Why to use S3 ?

Automation - has huge scope to use automation apis
granular control who has access to what
integration with other AWS services
shared storagw

No storage limit

object URL -- Bucket name + key

Block all -- enable
enable ACL
make public

Ways to upload
portal , CLI
S3 APIs

RDS , database 

DB -- store data in a certain format and analyse from it

Relational -- structred in nature means it has fixed format and we have to honour that
It in form of rows and columns
financial companies



Nonrelational/ NO SQL -- A non-relational database stores data in a non-tabular form, 
and tends to be more flexible than the traditional, SQL-based, relational database structures.

Managed service - Hardware , S/W , patching , licence
-OracleDB

CloudFront --CDN 

Problem -- single server distribution 
eg see white board - user who is present in india accessing anything in US how to reduce latency  ?
CDN
Which OTT platform work best 
Youtube and netflix . why because of CDN 
What is CDN - caching content closer to end user using geographically located servers
It caches static content

simple reduce distance between user and data
Can be done using Edge locations (Edge locations - collection of servers ). caching data closer to end user.
Regional Edge cache
